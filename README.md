# Image-Caption-Generator
Our brain is capable of classifying images whenever they appear in front of us. How can computers analyze an image and what the image is about? It's unachievable a few years ago but now with the development of Computer Vision and Deep Learning algorithms, as well as the availability of appropriate datasets and AI models, it is possible to create a meaningful caption for a picture.
Image caption generator is a web application that uses deep learning and computer vision algorithms to recognize the context of an image and describe it with relevant captions using text and audio. The dataset contains both images and texts to train the machine learning model. The text description for each image is generated by Natural Language Processing techniques.

List of things we tackled in this project:
documentation ✅
model as a service ✅
user interface (uploading images and opening the camera) ✅
connection backend to frontend(APIs) ✅

To run the project kindly run the following first.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Frontend. 
we used Streamlit to create a web application for uploading a pictures
  
to run the Sreamlit server run the following:  
```
streamlit run trialstre.py
```

## Backend. 
we used Flask to build our APIs and to have the model as a service. In order to run flask server you need to set the FLASK_APP variable using:  
```
export FLASK_APP='trialflask.py'. 
```
then you run the server using:  
```
flask run
```
